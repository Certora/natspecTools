        "text": "## Verification of Initializable\n\n`Initializable` is a contract used to make constructors for upgradeable\ncontracts. This is accomplished by applying the `initializer` modifier to any\nfunction that serves as a constructor, which makes this function only\ncallable once. The secondary modifier `reinitializer` allows for upgrades\nthat change the contract's initializations. \n        \n\n### Assumptions and Simplifications\nWe assume `initializer()` and `reinitializer(1)` are equivalent if they\nboth guarentee `_initialized` to be set to 1 after a successful call. This\nallows us to use `reinitializer(n)` as a general version that also handles\nthe regular `initialzer` case.\n      \n#### Harnessing\nTwo harness versions were implemented, a simple flat contract, and a\nMulti-inheriting contract. The two versions together help us ensure there are\nNo unexpected results because of different implementions. Initializable can\nBe used in many different ways but we believe these 2 cases provide good\nCoverage for all cases. In both harnesses we use getter functions for\n`_initialized` and `_initializing` and implement  `initializer` and\n`reinitializer` functions that use their respective modifiers. We also\nImplement some versioned functions that are only callable in specific\nVersions of the contract to mimick upgrading contracts.\n        \n#### Munging\nVariables `_initialized` and `_initializing` were changed to have internal\nvisibility to be harnessable."
